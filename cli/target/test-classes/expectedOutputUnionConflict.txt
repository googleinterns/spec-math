There were conflicts in the union process

Please see the file src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS for more information

To resolve the conflicts you have three choices:
1: Updating the "resolvedValue" property in src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS with your desired option, and then passing that file into the union as an additional parameter using the -c flag

2: Looking at src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS and manually updating the input YAML files

3: Updating/creating a defaults file with overrides for the conflicting keypaths in src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS, and passing in the new defaults file into the union as an additional parameter using the -d flag
